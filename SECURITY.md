## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a security vunerability using github issues with the vunerability label. I will monitor these issues and fix them asap.

<!--
Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
